ABSTRACT

In this paper we present a coherent timing analysis of the 401 Hz pulsations of the accreting mil-
lisecond X-ray pulsar SAX J1808.4–3658 during its 2019 outburst. Using observations collected with
the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER), we establish the pulsar spin frequency and
orbital phase during its latest epoch. We ﬁnd that the 2019 outburst shows a pronounced evolution in
pulse phase over the course of the outburst. These phase shifts are found to correlate with the source
ﬂux, and are interpreted in terms of hot-spot drift on the stellar surface, driven by changes in the mass
accretion rate. Additionally, we ﬁnd that the long-term evolution of the pulsar spin frequency shows
evidence for a modulation at the Earth’s orbital period, enabling pulsar timing based astrometry of
this accreting millisecond pulsar.

1. INTRODUCTION

The low-mass X-ray binary SAX J1808.4–3658 (here-
after SAX J1808) is the canonical example of an accret-
ing millisecond X-ray pulsar (AMXP). First discovered
as an X-ray source in 1996 with the BeppoSAX satel-
lite (in ’t Zand et al. 1998), it was not until 1998 that
the detection of 401 Hz pulsations with the Rossi X-ray
Timing Explorer (RXTE ) established this source as the
ﬁrst known AMXP (Wijnands & van der Klis 1998).
Over the two decades since this discovery, the sample
size of known AMXPs has grown substantially (Patruno
& Watts 2012; Campana & Di Salvo 2018). Despite this
growth, however, SAX J1808 remains the cornerstone
of its class. This status is in part due to its relatively
close proximity, at an estimated distance of 3.5 kpc (Gal-
loway & Cumming 2006), and in part due to its short,
semi-regular outburst recurrence times of 2 − 4 years.
Together, these qualities have enabled extensive inves-
tigations of its pulsations (Poutanen & Gierli´nski 2003;
Hartman et al. 2008; Burderi et al. 2009; Patruno et al.
2017; Sanna et al. 2017), its aperiodic variability (Wi-
jnands et al. 2001; Patruno et al. 2009b; Bult & van
der Klis 2015a,b), its spectral characteristics (Gierli´nski

∗ NASA Postdoctoral Fellow

et al. 2002; Cackett et al. 2009; Papitto et al. 2009; Di
Salvo et al. 2019), and its thermonuclear X-ray bursts
(in ’t Zand et al. 2001; Chakrabarty et al. 2003; Gal-
loway & Cumming 2006; Bhattacharyya & Strohmayer
2007; in ’t Zand et al. 2013).

The characteristic property of an AMXP is its coher-
ently pulsed emission. These oscillations have nearly si-
nusoidal proﬁles that are attributed to a localized emis-
sion region, a hot-spot, on the neutron star surface.
Such a hot-spot arises due to the dynamically relevant
stellar magnetosphere, which channels in-falling plasma,
so that the accretion column impacts the stellar surface
in conﬁned regions near the magnetic poles. These pul-
sations reveal a host of information about the neutron
star, with the precise waveform encoding information on
the stellar compactness (Poutanen & Gierli´nski 2003),
and their phase evolution with time revealing the spin
evolution of the binary and star itself (Hartman et al.
2008).

For SAX J1808 speciﬁcally, coherent timing analyses
of the pulsations revealed that the X-ray outbursts do
not show a measurable accretion-powered spin change
(Hartman et al. 2008, 2009; Patruno et al. 2012, 2017;
Sanna et al. 2017), while between outbursts the source
spins down at a steady rate of ≈ 1.5 × 10−15 Hz s−1.
Additionally, these analyses revealed the 2.01 hr bi-
nary orbit (Chakrabarty & Morgan 1998), and estab-

2

lished a peculiar long-term variation of the binary pe-
riod. The ﬁrst decade of monitoring showed that the
binary period was expanding at an anomalously fast
rate of ≈ 3.5 × 10−12 s s−1 (di Salvo et al. 2008; Hart-
man et al. 2008), which was explained as being due to
highly non-conservative mass-transfer (di Salvo et al.
2008; Burderi et al. 2009), or, alternatively, due to spin-
orbit angular momentum exchange in the companion
star (Hartman et al. 2008; Patruno et al. 2012), akin
to short-term orbital variability observed in millisecond
“black widow” radio pulsars (Arzoumanian et al. 1994;
Doroshenko et al. 2001). Later outbursts, in 2011 and
2015, showed that the rate of orbital expansion is itself
evolving rapidly. These measurements have been anal-
ysed in great detail (Patruno et al. 2017; Sanna et al.
2017), but for a lack of data points, no single conclusion
could yet be reached.

On 2019 July 30, Russell et al. (2019a) reported a
brightening in the optical i’-band from the direction of
SAX J1808, which is often a precursor to a full X-ray
outburst (Russell et al. 2019b). Although this predictor
had not previously been tested for SAX J1808 specif-
ically, various X-ray, UV, and radio observatories were
triggered to monitor SAX J1808 over the following days.
On 2019 August 6 a further increase in the optical i’-
band was observed, coincident with a ﬂux increase in the
X-ray band (Goodwin et al. 2019b) and UV (Parikh &
Wijnands 2019), suggesting the source was indeed start-
ing a new outburst. On 2019 August 7 the X-ray ﬂux
started increasing rapidly, and the detection of 401 Hz
pulsations (Bult et al. 2019c) with the Neutron Star In-
terior Composition Explorer (NICER; Gendreau & Ar-
zoumanian 2017) conﬁrmed that SAX J1808 was indeed
active again.

Following conﬁrmation of a new outburst, we executed
an extensive, high cadence monitoring campaign with
NICER. In this paper we report on a timing analysis of
the coherent pulsations for these data.

2. OBSERVATIONS

We observed SAX J1808 with NICER between 2019
July 30 and 2019 August 31 for a total unﬁltered ex-
posure of 355.4 ks. These data are available under pro-
gram/target numbers 205026 and 258401. At the time
of the ﬁnal observation included in the present analy-
sis, the source had completed the high luminosity phase
of its outburst cycle, but remained visible in its char-
acteristic prolonged ﬂaring tail (Wijnands et al. 2001;
Patruno et al. 2009b, 2016; Bult et al. 2019b).

We processed all data using nicerdas version 6a,
which is distributed as part of heasoft v6.26. We
applied standard screening criteria, limiting our anal-
ysis to time intervals with a pointing oﬀset < 54(cid:48)(cid:48), a
bright Earth limb angle > 30◦, a dark Earth limb an-
gle > 15◦, and collected outside the South Atlantic
Anomaly. The standard processing also applies a back-
ground screening ﬁlter, which rejects all time inter-

vals where the rate of saturating particle events (over-
shoots) is greater than 1 ct s−1 detector−1, or greater
than 1.52 × cor sax−0.633, where cor sax1 gives the
cut-oﬀ rigidity of the Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld, in units
of GeV c−1. For the SAX J1808 observations, we ﬁnd
that this approach is often too conservative, as statis-
tical ﬂuctuations in the overshoot rate are leading to
many unnecessary 1 − 10 s gaps in the light curve. We
therefore applied a smoothing average ﬁlter to the over-
shoot light curve using a 5 second window. Addition-
ally, we relaxed the cut-oﬀ threshold for the overshoots
to 1.5 ct s−1 detector−1 and increased the scaling factor
of the cor sax expression from 1.52 to 2.0. A visual
comparison of light curves based on standard and re-
laxed ﬁltering showed that no spurious signals were in-
troduced in this way. Using these criteria, we retained
257.7 ks of good time exposure. These good time data
were corrected to the Solar System barycenter using the
barycorr tool, where we used the optical coordinates
of Hartman et al. (2008) and the JPL DE405 planetary
ephemeris (Standish 1998). All times reported in this
work are therefore expressed in units of Barycentric Dy-
namical Time (TDB). Finally, we estimated the back-
ground contributions to our data from NICER obser-
vations of the RXTE blank-ﬁeld regions (Jahoda et al.
2006).

Two thermonuclear X-ray bursts were observed with
NICER, the ﬁrst on August 9 and the second on August
21. We exclude both events from the analysis presented
here. An initial analysis of the second bursts is presented
in Bult et al. (2019a). An analysis of the ﬁrst burst,
and a separate, detailed review of the spectroscopic and
stochastic variability will be presented elsewhere.

3. COHERENT TIMING

We performed a coherent timing analysis of the 401 Hz
pulsations of SAX J1808. For each continuous good-
time interval we corrected the photon arrival times for
the Doppler delays of the binary motion based on the
preliminary ephemeris of Bult et al. (2019c). We then
folded the data on the pulsar period to construct a pulse
proﬁle. This proﬁle was decomposed into its Fourier
components by ﬁtting a constant plus k harmonic sinu-
soids. Each sinusoid thus has a ﬁxed frequency νk = kνp,
where νp is the pulsar spin frequency. Additionally, for
each sinusoid we determined the phase, ϕk, and ampli-
tude, Ak, from which we derive a ﬁducial pulse arrival
time and a fractional sinusoidal amplitude, r, as

r =

Ak

Nγ − B

,

(1)

where Nγ gives the number of photons in the pulse
proﬁle, and B gives the estimated number of photons

ity that was originally developed for the BeppoSAX satellite. It
has no relation to the source SAX J1808.

contributed by the background emission. A harmonic
was deemed signiﬁcant if its measured amplitude ex-
ceeded the 99% conﬁdence amplitude threshold of the
noise distribution. When a harmonic was not signiﬁ-
cantly detected, we instead computed an upper limit on
the amplitude as the minimum signal that would have
produced a measured amplitude in excess of the noise
threshold 95% of the time.

Pulsations at the fundamental frequency are detected
at high signiﬁcance throughout the outburst (Figure 1,
1st and 2nd panel). For a number of segments, however,
the integration time was too short to reach a detection.
Given the small number of cases, we did not attempt
to combine these segments with neighboring intervals,
and show an upper limit on the amplitude instead. The
second harmonic was rarely detected, mainly because its
amplitude is small below 3 keV (Patruno et al. 2009a),
where NICER is most sensitive.
Indeed, by accumu-
lating more exposure in each pulse proﬁle, we could
detect the second harmonic signiﬁcantly in more seg-
ments. However, the required integration times were
long (> 5 ks), greatly reducing the number of measured
pulse arrival times. Hence, we focus our analysis on the
arrival times of the fundamental pulsation.

The series of pulse arrival times was modeled as a
constant spin frequency and a circular Keplerian orbit
using tempo2 (Hobbs et al. 2006). Hence, our initial
model consisted of four parameters: the binary orbital
period, Pb, the projected semi-major axis, ax sin i, the
time of passage through the ascending node, Tasc, and
the spin frequency, νp. After an initial ﬁt, we repeated
the epoch-folding method using the reﬁned ephemeris,
and repeated the entire procedure until the solution con-
verged.

At a reduced χ2 (χ2

r ) of 7.2 for 259 degrees of freedom
(dof), we ﬁnd that our initial model provided a poor de-
scription to the set of arrival times, leaving an approxi-
mately parabolic trend in the phase residuals (Figure 1,
3rd panel). This trend suggests that the spin frequency
is changing over the course of the outburst. Indeed, in-
cluding a spin frequency derivative in our timing model
improves the ﬁt statistic to a χ2
r of 2.27 for 258 dof. Con-
sidering the ﬁt residuals, however, we ﬁnd large phase
residuals near the start and end of our data set (Figure
1, 4th panel). This suggests that additional, higher spin
frequency derivatives, for which there is little physical
motivation, are needed to describe the data

An important consideration in the coherent timing
is
analysis of accreting millisecond pulsars, however,
leading to
that the pulse proﬁles can change shape,
both gradual and abrupt shifts in the observed phase
(see Patruno & Watts 2012, for a review). Indeed, in
SAX J1808 the pulse waveform is known to be sensitive
to the source ﬂux (Patruno et al. 2009c). We therefore
generalized our timing model by expressing the pulsar

the phase correction associated with the binary orbit,
and ϕbias(Fbol) gives a phase-bias correction term as
a function of bolometric ﬂux, Fbol.
In order to spec-
ify a bias function, we note that numerical simulations
indicate that the azimuthal position of the hot-spot is
proportional to the magnetospheric radius (Kulkarni &
Romanova 2013). Additionally, the magnetospheric ra-
dius is predicted to scale with the mass accretion rate as
˙M−1/5 (D’Angelo & Spruit 2010; Kulkarni & Romanova
2013). Since ˙M should be proportional to the bolomet-
ric ﬂux, we deﬁne a simple power-law model

bol,

ϕbias(Fbol) = bF Γ

(3)
with Γ ﬁxed at −1/5, and b a free scaling factor, which
we will refer to as the scale of the bias. Finally, for sim-
plicity, we use count-rate as an approximate substitute
for the ﬂux. Applying this generalized model to our ar-
rival times, we obtain a χ2
r of 2.08 for 258 dof. While this
ﬁt statistic is still not formally acceptable, it performs
better than the quadratic phase model. Furthermore,
we note that phase residuals for this model (Figure 1,
5th panel) are no longer structured, such that the poor
statistic can be attributed to residual timing noise (Pa-
truno & Watts 2012).

Finally, we note that our data quality is suﬃcient that
the Keplerian parameters describing the binary orbit
are eﬀectively decoupled from the parameters describ-
ing the spin frequency evolution.
Indeed, in all three
models discussed above, the Keplerian parameters agree
within their respective uncertainties. Hence, in Table
1 we list the best-ﬁt timing solution for the orbit sep-
arately from spin frequency parameters obtained from
the three phase models.

4. PULSE ENERGY DEPENDENCE

To investigate the photon-energy dependence of the
pulsations, we applied a sliding window method in en-
ergy space. That is, we selected all data in a 0.25 keV
wide window and measured the resulting pulse proﬁle
properties. We then repeated this analysis by mov-
ing the window from 0.5 keV to 10 keV using steps of
0.1 keV. This method was applied to four representa-
tive time intervals. The ﬁrst interval covers August 10
through 17, which is when the outburst peaked and the
broad-band fractional pulse amplitude remained con-
stant at 5%. The second interval covers August 18
through 20, which is where the source ﬂux showed a
re-brightening with respect to its long-term decay, and,
likewise, the broad-band fractional pulse amplitude tem-
porarily increased to 7%. The third interval covers Au-
gust 21 through 25, where the outburst continued its
decay and the fractional pulse amplitude varied between
4% and 7%. Finally, the fourth group covers August 26
through 31 where the source began to transition to its
ﬂaring state, and the broad-band fractional pulse ampli-
tude increased above 7%, indicating an associated tran-

sition in the pulse waveform. The resulting pulse ampli-
tude and phase spectra are shown in Figure 2.

Consistent with previous results (Patruno et al. 2009a;
Sanna et al. 2017), we ﬁnd that the pulse amplitude in-
creases with energy up to ≈ 2 keV, and then ﬂattens
oﬀ (top panel). More interesting, however, is to note
that the overall pulse energy spectrum shows signiﬁcant
evolution with time. As the source brieﬂy re-brightens
during its decay (second panel), the amplitude spectrum
hardens, but the phase remains mostly the same. How-
ever, as the source intensity drops further, the phase
residuals below 2 keV begin to pivot, as the fractional
amplitudes below 2 keV show large variations (third and
bottom panels).

5. LONG TERM EVOLUTION

5.1. Spin frequency

Between 1998 and 2011,

the spin frequency of
SAX J1808 decreased at a constant rate (Patruno et al.
2012; for the 2015 outburst, see discussion). In Figure 3
we compare the three spin frequencies measured for the
2019 data with this established spin-down trend. The
historic data for this comparison was adopted from Hart-
man et al. (2008, 2009) and Patruno et al. (2012). The
frequencies of the linear and ﬂux-adjusted phase models

both conﬁrm a continuation of the long-term spin-down.
The frequency derived from the quadratic phase model,
however, lies well away from the trend. To quantita-
tively model the spin frequency evolution, we adopt the
frequency from the linear phase model, as that model is
the most similar to the historic data (see Section 6.1).

While there is a clear decreasing trend in the long
term evolution of the spin frequency, a linear function
does not provide a statistically acceptable description of
these data (χ2
r of 5.1 for 5 dof). If we remove the long-
term linear spin-down trend, and consider the residuals
as a function of day of year, we observe an apparently si-
nusoidal modulation at the Earth’s orbital period. This
result suggests that our source coordinates are slightly
oﬀset from the optical position, such that the barycen-
ter correction leaves a small periodic Doppler shift in
the data (Manchester & Peters 1972; Manchester et al.
1974; Lyne & Graham-Smith 1990).

To account for the uncertainty in the source coordi-
nates, we modeled the long-term evolution of the spin
frequency as a linear trend plus a correction term for
the residual Doppler shift,

∆ν(t) = δν98 + ˙ν(t − T98) + D(t, δλ, δβ),

(4)

where ∆ν gives the measured spin frequency relative to
ν98, the spin frequency measured for the epoch of the
1998 outburst, T98. Additionally, δν98 gives the correc-
tion to the spin frequency, ˙ν the spin frequency deriva-
tive at T98, and D(t, δλ, δβ) the Doppler correction term,
which is deﬁned as
D(t, δλ, δβ) = νp

where a⊕ is the Earth’s circular orbital radius, c is

lar angular frequency, P⊕ is a sidereal year, and TΥ =
MJD 51079.143 is the epoch of zero degrees ecliptic lon-
gitude for the Earth’s orbit2. Finally, λ and β give the
respective source longitude and latitude in ecliptic co-
ordinates, with δλ and δβ their correction terms. We
further note that corrections associated with the Earth’s
orbital eccentricity are negligible, and can be safely ig-
nored. Applying this model to the data, we obtain a

that one might wonder if the source shows measurable
proper motion. To test for proper motion, we substi-
tuted the constant coordinate oﬀsets in Equation 5 with
their linear expansion in time, i.e.,

δλ(t) = δλ0 + µλ(t − Toptical)
δβ(t) = δβ0 + µβ(t − Toptical),

(6)
(7)

where Toptical = MJD 52703 gives the 2001 June 13 date
on which the optical data were collected (Hartman et al.
2008). Assuming the optical position was exactly cor-
rect (i.e., ﬁxing δλ0 and δβ0 to zero), we obtain a very
poor ﬁt (χ2
r of 7.1 for 3 dof). Letting all parameters
vary yields a χ2
r of 1.8 for 1 dof, with mean oﬀset of
δλ0 = 0.33(cid:48)(cid:48)± 0.10(cid:48)(cid:48) and δβ0 = −0.37(cid:48)(cid:48)± 0.40(cid:48)(cid:48), and with
ill-constrained derivatives of µλ = +0.013 ± 0.10(cid:48)(cid:48) yr−1
and µβ = −0.04± 0.03(cid:48)(cid:48) yr−1. Hence, the long-term spin
frequency measurements are best described using a ﬁxed
position oﬀset. We transform the pulsar timing source
position to equatorial coordinates, and list them in Ta-
ble 2, along with the associated spin frequency and its
derivative.

Finally, we note that similar results can be obtained
by adopting the spin frequency obtained from the ﬂux-
adjusted phase model.
In this case the long term
spin down was slightly smaller, at ˙ν = (−8.5 ± 0.5) ×
10−16 Hz s−1, while the measured oﬀset in ecliptic lati-
tude reduced to δβ = −0.40(cid:48)(cid:48) ± 0.19(cid:48)(cid:48) and the oﬀset in
ecliptic longitude was δλ = 0.28(cid:48)(cid:48) ± 0.07(cid:48)(cid:48).

5.2. Orbital period

To study the long-term evolution of the orbital pe-
riod, we follow the procedure of Hartman et al. (2008)
and calculate the residual time of passage through the
ascending node, ∆Tasc, as

∆Tasc = Tasc,i − (Tref + N Pb),

(8)

where we set the reference time to the epoch of the 2002
outburst, Tref = 52499.96. Additionally, Tasc,i is the
time of ascending node measured for the ith outburst,
N is the number of orbital revolutions between the ith
outburst and Tref , and Pb gives the orbital period re-
ported by Hartman et al. (2009). These residual delays
are shown in Figure 5. For context, we also show the
parabolic model of Hartman et al. (2009), and the resid-
uals with respect to this model.

The ∆Tasc measured for the 2019 outburst represents
a signiﬁcant lead with respect to the model of Hart-
man et al. (2009). From Figure 5 we see that this oﬀ-
set is a continuation of a recent trend, which suggests
that the binary orbit has been contracting in the re-
cent decade. Indeed, when we consider only the second

decade of measurements (2008 through 2019), then we
can ﬁt the ∆Tasc evolution with a parabolic function
(χ2
r of 0.02 for 1 dof). This ﬁt yields an orbital period
derivative of

˙Pb = (−5.18 ± 0.02) × 10−12 s s−1.

Considering all data, we ﬁnd that the mean long-term
˙Pb =
trend of the ∆Tasc yields a period derivative of
(1.6±0.7)×10−12 s s−1. The residuals around this mean
trend show a large amplitude oscillation with a period of
approximately 18.2 years. This oscillation is clearly not
sinusoidal, and could also not be adequately described
as time delays due to a third body in an eccentric orbit.
Instead, this quasi-periodic oscillation is apparently a
stochastic process that is intrinsic to the dynamics of the
binary orbit (see, e.g., Patruno et al. 2017; Sanna et al.
2017, for detailed modeling). What is not clear from the
available data is whether this quasi-periodic process has
a ≈ 7 s amplitude around a steadily expanding orbit, or
if we are seeing a ≈ 20 s amplitude modulation around a
constant binary period. Additional monitoring of future
outbursts is needed to diﬀerentiate between these two
scenarios.

We have presented a coherent timing analysis of the
2019 outburst of SAX J1808 as observed with NICER.
We found that over the course of the outburst, the pulse
phase changes as a function of the count-rate. Consider-
ing the long-term evolution, we found there is now suﬃ-
cient data for pulsar timing astrometry. In the following
we consider some of the implications of these results.

6.1. Spin frequency evolution

We modeled the long-term evolution of the neutron
star spin frequency by taking into account possible fre-
quency shifts due to the position uncertainty. We found
that this model gave a statistically acceptable descrip-
tion of the measurements, implying that we obtained an
improved source position through pulsar timing astrom-
etry. The timing position obtained through this analysis
is consistent with the optical at a 2.3σ level. Given that
the 0.15(cid:48)(cid:48) uncertainty in the optical position is set by
the systematic uncertainty in the 2MASS catalog (Hart-
man et al. 2008), we investigated if the relatively large
oﬀset between the optical and pulsar timing positions
could be explained through proper motion. However, we
found that no signiﬁcant proper motion could be mea-
sured from the pulsar timing data.

An important caveat to this analysis is that the aver-
aged spin frequency measured in each outburst is sub-
ject to systematic modelling uncertainty (as is clear from
Table 1). For consistency, we only used spin frequency
measurements that were obtained using a linear phase
model (Hartman et al. 2008, 2009). While Patruno
et al. (2009c) report slightly oﬀset spin frequency mea-
surements using a ﬂux correction, there is an impor-
tant distinction between the way we modeled the ﬂux-
adjustment and their work. Patruno et al. (2009c) de-
termined the optimal timing solution by minimizing a
linear ﬁt to the phase-ﬂux correlation, as a function of
pulse frequency. In contrast, we incorporated the bias
term directly into the phase model through a physically
motivated power-law dependence. Hence, the reference
frame of our ﬂux-adjusted phase model is not guaranteed
to be the same as that of Patruno et al. (2009c). Be-
cause a complete reanalysis of the archival RXTE data
is beyond the scope of this work, we applied our spin-
down analysis to the linear phase model. While this
choice may have introduced some bias into our best-ﬁt
solution, the main implication of our analysis is that we
now have a suﬃciently long baseline of measurements
for SAX J1808 that astrometric eﬀects can no longer
be treated as uncertainties, but instead should be ac-
counted for in the timing analysis.

Finally, we note that we did not include a spin fre-
quency measurement from the 2015 outburst. While
a spin frequency was determined for this outburst us-
ing XMM-Newton and NuSTAR (Sanna et al. 2017),
as well as with Chandra (Patruno et al. 2017), each
of these measurements suﬀers from substantial statisti-
cal and systematic uncertainty. Speciﬁcally, the XMM-

Newton and NuSTAR data suﬀered from clock drifts,
which limited the absolute time resolution. The Chan-
dra data, on the other hand, was collected late in the
outburst, when the source had already decayed to low
ﬂux levels. These data have relatively poor statistical
uncertainty on the frequency measurements. Addition-
ally, all these observations only sample a very limited
ﬂux range, and are potentially biased by the ﬂux-phase
relation.

6.2. Hot-spot drift

We found that, over the course of the 2019 out-
burst, the pulse phase showed signiﬁcant evolution rel-
ative to a constant spin frequency model. We at-
tempted to account for this evolution with two ap-
proaches: a quadratic phase model, and a ﬂux-adjusted
phase model.

The quadratic phase model accounts for the phase
drift by adding a spin frequency derivative to the tim-
ing model. The physical interpretation of this model is
that accretion torques applied during outburst are mea-
surably aﬀecting the spin frequency of the neutron star.
While this model mostly accounts for the observed phase
drift, there are signiﬁcant issues with it. First, the resid-
uals still show a (minor) systematic trend that is not
consistent with timing noise. Second, the spin frequency
derivative obtained through this model is anomalous. At
−3× 10−13 Hz s−1, the derivative implies that the accre-
tion torque is spinning-down the neutron star. Previous
outbursts did not show such a spin-down. Although
some early work on SAX J1808 report spin changes on
the order of 10−13 Hz s−1 (Morgan et al. 2003; Burderi
et al. 2007), the sign and magnitude of the derivative
change depending on how the data are selected, based
on which Hartman et al. (2008) argued that the observed
phase changes are actually rooted in the shape changes
of the pulse waveform. Third, we expect that the ac-
cretion torque acts in the same manner for every out-
burst, so by rescaling the apparent spin-down measured
in 2019 based on the outburst recurrence cycle, we ob-
tain a long-time averaged accretion-powered spin down
of −6 × 10−15 Hz s−1. This rate is signiﬁcantly higher
than the long-term spin down that is actually observed.
Furthermore, the mean 2019 spin frequency obtained
from this model is actually larger than the mean spin
frequency measured during the 2011 outburst, further
exacerbating this inconsistency. Given these contradic-
tions, we conclude that the quadratic phase model is not
physical.

In our second approach, we accounted for the phase
shifts by adding a ﬂux-dependent adjustment to our tim-
ing model. The physical interpretation for this phase
model is that the location of the hot-spot on the stellar
surface is not ﬁxed.
Instead, the hot-spot drifts as a
function of mass accretion rate, causing apparent phase
shifts that are not related to the stellar rotation (Ro-
manova et al. 2003; Lamb et al. 2009; Patruno et al.

2009c). To describe the hot-spot drift, we adopted a
power-law term in our phase model (Equation 3). This
ﬂux-adjusted model performs signiﬁcantly better than
the quadratic model discussed above. The spin fre-
quency obtained through this model is larger than that
of the linear phase model (by 90 nHz, or 6σ), but still
broadly consistent with the long term spin-down trend.
Our choice for a power-law dependence, and its −1/5
index, was guided by numerical simulations of accre-
tion onto magnetic stars (Kulkarni & Romanova 2013).
These simulations indicate that the azimuthal position
of the hot-spot relative to the magnetic pole scales lin-
early with the magnetospheric radius as

,

(9)

where rm is the magnetospheric radius and rc the co-
rotation radius. The latter is deﬁned as the radius at
which the Keplerian orbital frequency matches the spin
frequency,

(cid:18) GM

rc =

(10)

with G the gravitational constant, M the neutron star
mass, and Ω = 2πνp the angular spin frequency of the
neutron star. The former is deﬁned as the inner trunca-
tion radius of the accretion disk, which follows from bal-
ancing the magnetospheric stresses against the material
stresses in the accretion disk. The classical deﬁnition is

with R the neutron star radius. The accretion rate can
be estimated from the bolometric ﬂux through the re-
lation 4πd2Fbol = GM ˙M /R.
In Section 3 we further
assumed that the bolometric ﬂux, Fbol, is proportional
to the observed count-rate. To calibrate this relation, we
ﬁt each continuous good time interval using an absorbed
multi-temperature disk blackbody and a Compontized
power-law (see also, Papitto et al. 2009; Di Salvo et al.
2019; Bult et al. 2019a). For each spectrum, we then es-
timated the bolometric ﬂux by extrapolating the model
between 0.01 keV and 100 keV. The resulting ﬂuxes were
indeed nearly proportional to the 0.5 − 10 keV count-
rate, Λ, with

Fb = κΛ,

(12)
where we measured κ = 4.14 × 10−12 erg cm−2 ct−1.
Rewriting these expressions, we ﬁnd, for the azimuthal
position of the hot-spot,

φ0 ∝ −135◦βΛ−1/5,

Thus, from theory, we expect that the scale of our count-
rate dependent bias should be b = −1.09, which is oﬀ-
set by about 20% from the b = −0.87 that we actually
measured using our ﬂux-adjusted phase model (Table
1). This oﬀset can be accounted by varying the neutron
star parameters within their allowed ranges (Galloway
& Cumming 2006; Hartman et al. 2008; Goodwin et al.
2019a), but only if µ < 1.2 × 1026 G cm3 (see Figure 6).
The magnetic moment of SAX J1808 has been con-
strained to (0.7−1.4)×1026 G cm3 (Hartman et al. 2008;
Patruno et al. 2012). The upper limit follows from re-
lating the long-term spin down trend to magnetic dipole
radiation. The lower limit is obtained by requiring that,
at the highest luminosities, the magnetic ﬁeld be strong

enough to truncate the disk at the neutron star radius
(Psaltis & Chakrabarty 1999), although we note this
value changes depending on speciﬁc assumptions for the
source distance and the neutron star parameters (see,
e.g., Mukherjee et al. 2015, for an overview).
In this
context, the upper limit on µ that we obtained through
the bias scale may indicate that the magnetic dipole
radiation is not the only source of torque applied to
the neutron star.
Instead, an additional torque may
be present in the form of the propeller mechanism (Il-
larionov & Sunyaev 1975; D’Angelo & Spruit 2010), or
gravitational wave emission due to a neutron star mass
quadrupole (Wagoner 1984; Bildsten 1998; Andersson &
Kokkotas 2001; Melatos & Payne 2005; Mahmoodifar &
Strohmayer 2013).

Alternatively, the tension between the magnetic mo-
ment from the spin-down trend and that from the bias
scale could be attributed to uncertainties related to the
disk-magnetosphere boundary region. By determining
the point at which the magnetic ﬁeld is strong enough
to force the disk into co-rotation, D’Angelo & Spruit
(2010) derive the magnetospheric radius as

(cid:18) ηµ2

(15)

where η parameterizes the poorly understood magnetic
diﬀusivity of the accretion disk. We point out that this
relation almost exactly matches Equation 11 when η = 1
and the neutron star mass and radius are ﬁxed to the
values used in the simulations of Kulkarni & Romanova
(2013). The diﬀerent dependence on R is due to the
assumption of what the orbital velocity at the inner edge
of the disk should be. Using equation 15 we can derive
an alternative expression for β as

Assuming magnetic dipole radiation is the dominant
source of spin-down torque (i.e., setting µ = 1.4 ×
1026 G cm3), we can constrain η to ≈ 0.3−0.4 (see Figure
7).

While these constraints are subject to the various un-
certainties in the numerical modelling, the fact that we
can successfully describe the systematic timing noise us-
ing a physical model provides a strong argument in favor
of this interpretation. Additionally, that we can obtain
reasonable values for the properties of the neutron star
bodes well for future eﬀorts in detailed waveform mod-
elling of accreting millisecond pulsars. In this analysis

form modelling of SAX J1808 may not only reveal the
neutron star mass and radius, but also constrain the de-
tailed physics of the disk-magnetosphere boundary re-
gion.
